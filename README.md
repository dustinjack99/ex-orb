# Ex-Orb
An interactive planetary map of NASA's exoplanet data.

## Process
This project was my first foray into using Angular, in place of React, and also my first deployment to Azure. Before even starting, I had to learn how to make a containerized app in Docker. Once I wrestled with the config, CI/CD, and deploying the app as a container, the real work could begin.

The app fetches data from NASA's Exoplanet API. I wanted to make an app that splashes all the systems onto a map, then when you click on a star system, it displays all the planets rotating around its host star. This is where I want into the largest hurdle: it turns out celestial latitude and longitude is different than terrestrial latitude and longitude. 

### Terrestrial Lat / Long

### Celestial Lat / Long

## Outcome
